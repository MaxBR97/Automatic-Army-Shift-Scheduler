# Automatic-Army-Shift-Scheduler
This project is an automatic scheduler of patrols and/or shifts.

## Features
 * Uses a complex non-linear optimization algorithm (Nonlinear Programming) to achieve optimum of the result!
 * Allows defining the shifts, their times, the hours at which each person is available (if at all), amount of people needed for each shift, and definition of night shifts.
 * Allows defining constraints of infeasible assignments, such as minimum rest time between two shifts, restrictions two night shifts within two nights for the same person, etc.
 * Assigns shifts with consideration of previous shift assignments (history), to keep fairness.
 * Applies a degree of randomness, in order to avoid bias towards certain individuals.

### This project was written for my military unit (batallion 9242, platoon Gimel) during Iron Swords war. It was planned, designed and implemented in a tent, in the field, in between shellings.
